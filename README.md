# Wine Classification & Deploying API/Apps

Deployed app: https://share.streamlit.io/esdfirls/wine-prediction/main/streamtest.py


## Problem
Problem: Identify the quality of a wine from its properties

Gaps: A taster's analysis can be subjective and may not be sufficient to determine the quality of the wine.

Hypothesis: The analysis of physicochemical properties can be used to create a model with the objective of predicting the quality

Goals: Extract data from wine data, analyze and apply Machine Learning with the intention of getting future classification.

## Data
Data Available: Kaggle Repository.

License: Free Access.

## Tools and APIs
Tools: Python, Jupyter, Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask, PyQT5, Streamlit.

APIs: Flask (winepredict.azurewebsites.net/),
Example for predict in API: (https://winepredict.azurewebsites.net/wine?tipo=1&fixed=7&volatile=1&citric=1&residual=45&chlorides=0.5&freesulfur=100&totalsulfur=200&density=1&ph=3.3&sulphates=1&alcohol=12)

Pricing: Free.

Access: Free Instance in Azure, Time Limited. without Athentication.

## Evaluation
Test Data: Creation of test set, algorithm evaluation and cross validation

Evaluation: Perform the solution on the test data and present the classification precision metrics.
